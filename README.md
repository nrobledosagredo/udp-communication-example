## Overview  
This repository demonstrates client-server interaction using UDP sockets. It includes two client scripts and one server script to showcase fundamental message sending and receiving functionality. Created as part of a learning project to explore UDP communication protocols.

## Features

- **UDP socket implementation:** Demonstrates basic UDP communication between clients and a server.  
- **Multiple clients:** Includes two client scripts to simulate concurrent message sending.  
- **Server response handling:** Processes incoming messages and sends appropriate responses.  
- **Lightweight and modular:** Easy-to-understand scripts for learning purposes.  

## Setup  
1. **Clone the repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. **Run the server**:  
   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```

3. **Run the clients**:  
   Open separate terminal windows and run:  
   ```bash
   python client1.py
   python client2.py
   ```

4. The server will process messages from the clients and send responses.
